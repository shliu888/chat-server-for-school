**Friendly chat server so you can chat with your friends without even needing browser access**

1. Run server.py and follow instructions: make sure you use your **private** ip address
2. On the other user's machine, type in 'nc [server ip] 8000'    
**Note**: This program requires Netcat to run, which is not installed on Windows by default, so install it if you need to     
4. **Only works if both devices are on the same network, currently working to improve**

Commands:

/recent: View the most recent message        
/exit: Exit the chat
